# Spring-2020-ITCS-8150-IntelligentSystems
This repository will contains the projects and assignments of course ITCS 6150/8150: Intelligent Systems. This course has been taken in Spring 2020 semester, as part of my PhD degree at UNC Charlotte.

## [Project 1: 8-puzzle](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/8-puzzle)

## [Project 2: n-queen](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/blob/master/src/n-queens)

## [Project 3: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) - Map Coloring](https://github.com/biqar/puzzle-solver/tree/master/src/k-coloring)

A `K-coloring` of a map is an assignment of `K` colors, one to each country, in such a way that no 
two countries sharing a border have the same color. This problem can be translated to a constraint graph. 
A coloring of a graph G assigns a color to each vertex of `G`, with the restriction that two adjacent 
vertices never have the same color. The chromatic number of `G`, written `Ï‡(G)`, is the smallest number 
of colors needed to color `G`. 

In this project, we will experiment with map coloring techniques and compare the observed results in 
the context of `USA` and `Australia` maps. 

* Compute the chromatic number of USA and Australia map. 
* Experiment with both maps using the following methods [`without heuristics`]
    * Depth first search only 
    * Depth first search + forward checking
    * Depth first search + forward checking + propagation through singleton domains
* Experiment with both maps using the following methods `with heuristics` where the order of variables needs to be defined in the following order `MRV`, `Degree Constraint`, and `Least Constraining Value`
    * Depth first search only 
    * Depth first search + forward checking
    * Depth first search + forward checking + propagation through singleton domains
* Present the results in a tabular format
    * the number of backtracking happened and
    * the time required to compute the result.

### General instructions:

1. The project can be completed individually, or in a group of three max. 
    * Many students work alone, which is good. If you prefer to work in a group, you are responsible for making your own group. 
    * You can try here (Links to an external site.).  
2. Map visualization is preferred but not required.  For visualization you can use any framework or tool.

### Submission instructions:

1. Your program should be well documented, and you should turn in the following to canvas.
    * An external document describing the map coloring problem formulation, the program structure, global variables, the function/procedure to compute the heuristic function, and other functions/procedures, etc.
    * Your program source codes (with necessary inline documentation);
    * The execution results as specified above.
    * Each member must turn in everything in canvas.
2. 10% late submission penalty for each extra day. Cut-off: Three days after the deadline.

**Warning:** Any form of cheating will subject you to disciplinary act.

### Guideline for Experiments:
Here is a guideline to experiment with map coloring algorithms.

#### Without Heuristics
1. Define the order of states randomly for map coloring
2. Run the following algorithms for the same random order of states
    * Depth first search only 
    * Depth first search + forward checking
    * Depth first search + forward checking + propagation through singleton domain
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 at least four times. 
4. Show the results in a table for both maps

#### With Heuristics
1. Start with a state 
2. Run the following algorithms - this time, you will use heuristics to select next variable and value where appropriate at runtime
    * Depth first search only 
    * Depth first search + forward checking
    * Depth first search + forward checking + propagation through singleton domain
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 at least four times. 
4. Show the results in a table for both maps

Compare all results and analyze them.
